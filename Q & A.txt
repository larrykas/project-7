Project 7

1. Create a ruby class that uses “class variables” and “instance variables” how are these two different? ✔

The difference between instance and class variables is Class variables only have one copy that is shared by all the different objects of a class, whereas every object has it’s own personal copy of an instance variable. So, instance variables across different objects can have different values whereas class variables across different objects can have only one value.

2. Create a ruby class that uses “class methods” and “instance methods” how are these two different? ✔

Class methods are distinguished from instance methods by their definition. Class methods are defined by placing the class name and a period in front of the method name.

Example of class method:
class Foo
  def self.bar
    puts 'class method'
  end
end

3. Create a class that implements a “private” method. Why use private methods?

4. Create a class that implements a “protected” methods. Why use protected methods?

5. Read up on ruby class inheritance i.e. ✔ (http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_inheritance.html)

6. Create 3 classes. They should be named “Vehicle”, “Car”, “Truck”. Car and Truck should “inherit” from “Vehicle” ✔

7. Create a method in Vehicle and then “override” it in Car and Truck. Why would you override methods? ✔

8. Show an example of using “super” in your overrided methods. Why use super? ✔
